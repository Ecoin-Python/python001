# Exercise 1:
## Write a Python program to read the contents of a file named "numbers.txt" and calculate the sum of all the numbers in the file.

# Exercise 2:
## Write a Python program that prompts the user to enter a filename, reads the contents of that file, and writes the even numbers to a new file named "even_numbers.txt".

# Exercise 3:
## Write a Python program that prompts the user to enter two numbers and divides the first number by the second number. Handle the ZeroDivisionError and display an error message if the second number is zero.

# Exercise 4:
## Write a Python program that asks the user to enter a list of numbers separated by spaces. Convert the input into a list of integers and calculate the sum of the numbers. Handle the ValueError if the input cannot be converted to integers and display an error message.

# Exercise 5:
## Write a Python program that asks the user to enter their age. If the age is less than 0 or greater than 150, raise a custom exception called InvalidAgeException. Handle the exception and display an error message.

# Exercise 6:
## Write a Python program that asks the user to enter a list of numbers separated by spaces. Convert the input into a list of integers and calculate the sum of the numbers. Handle the ValueError if the input cannot be converted to integers and display an error message.

# Exercise 7:
## Write a Python program to read the contents of a file named "data.txt" and count the total number of words in the file.

# Exercise 8:
## Write a Python program that prompts the user to enter a sentence and saves the sentence to a file named "sentence.txt".

# Exercise 9:
## Write a Python program to read the contents of a file named "contacts.txt" where each line contains a name and phone number separated by a comma. Convert the data into a dictionary where the names are the keys and the phone numbers are the values.

# Exercise 10:
## Write a Python program that prompts the user to enter the name and age of a person and saves the data to a file named "people.txt" in the format "name:age".

# Exercise 10:
## Write a Python program to read the contents of a file named "inventory.txt" where each line contains the name of an item and its quantity separated by a colon. Convert the data into a dictionary where the item names are the keys and the quantities are the values.
